  "readme": "# Downshow\n\nA simple JavaScript library to convert HTML to markdown.\n\nThis library has no external dependencies, and has been tested \nin Chrome, Safari and Firefox. It probably works with Internet Explorer,\nbut your milage may vary.\n\nIt relies on javascript's DOM to parse the input HTML and produce the markdown\noutput.  In more detail, the DOM tree is processed in reverse breadth\nfirst search order, translating each supported Element to its markdown\nequivalent. Element attributes are ignored, and unsupported elements are\nstripped out.\n\nThe source code is released under the MIT license, and therefore places\nalmost no restrictions on what you can do with it.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nSuppose somehwere in your document you have the following html fragment.\n\n``` html\n<div id=\"content\">\n<h1>Downshow</h1>\nA simple JavaScript library to convert HTML to markdown.\n<h2>Quick Start</h2>\nThat was <strong>very</strong> simple right?\n</div>\n```\n\nUsing downshow you can easily convert this HTML fragment to markdown:\n\n```js\nvar html_content = document.getElementById('content').innerHTML;\nvar markdown = showdown(html_content);\nconsole.log(markdown);\n```\n\n## Uses and Limitations\n\nOne of the main uses of converting HTML to markdown, is to avoid the\nsecurity considerations that arise when storing and manipulating raw\nHTML which was produced by an (untrusted) third party.\n\nWith this in mind, downshow will strip any HTML tags from its output and\nproduce a safe subset of Markdown which contains no HTML markup. It\nwould be easy to overrride this behavior and allow certain tags and\nattributes to be passed along (for instance, allow span/div tags with\ntheir class and style attributes).\n\nAt the moment this functionality is not implemented (since I have no use\nfor it). However, if there is interest I can add this as an option to\nthe library.\n",
